                                by Mibi88

A small interpreter of a lisp dialect targetting embedded systems. Currently it
is in a very early state, so it is quite inefficient and it may have some bugs.

It is released under the BSD-3-Clause license.

Here is a TODO list of what will come next:

    TODO

[x] Set and delete variables (currently they can only be defined).
[ ] List management with head and tail.
[ ] Optimize tail recursion.
[ ] Variable amount of arguments passed to user defined functions.
[ ] Integer type.
[ ] User friendly way to define builtin functions.
[ ] Define to use fixed point math instead of floating point arithmetic (for
    higher performance on CPU without FPUs).
[ ] File importing.
[ ] Pattern matching?
[ ] Scopes?
[ ] Foreign function interface.
[ ] Generate bytecode?

    CHANGELOG
